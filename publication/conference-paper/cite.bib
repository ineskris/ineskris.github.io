  abstract = "There has been recently a renewed interest for variety mixtures
              due to their potential capacity to stabilize production through
              buffering abiotic and biotic stresses. Part of this results from
              complementarity and/or compensation between varieties which can
              be assessed under mixed stands only. Mixing ability of varieties
              can be partitioned into General and Specific Mixing Abilities
              (GMA and SMA) that have been estimated so far through the
              evaluation of binary mixtures in complete diallel designs.
              However, the number of mixtures increases exponentially with the
              number of studied varieties, and the only feasible devices are
              incomplete designs. Despite the long history of statistical
              analysis of variety mixtures, such incomplete design analysis has
              rarely been addressed so far. To fill the gap, we proposed a
              generalized statistical framework to assess mixing abilities
              based on mixed models and BLUP method, with an original modeling
              of plant-plant interactions. The approach has been applied to a
              panel of 25 winter wheat genotypes observed in two contrasted
              experimental designs: (i) an incomplete diallel of 75 binary
              mixtures, and (ii) a trial including higher order mixtures (four
              and eight components). The use of mixing ability models improved
              prediction accuracy (of modeled values for observed traits) in
              comparison to predictions from the mean of the pure stand
              components, especially in the first experiment. Genetic
              variability was detected for the GMA of yield and its components,
              whereas variability for SMA was lower. GMA predictions based on
              the diallel trial were highly correlated with the GMA of the
              second trial providing accurate inter-trial predictions. A new
              model has been proposed to jointly account for inter and
              intra-genotypic interactions for specific mixing ability, thus
              contributing to a better understanding of mixture functioning.
              This framework constitutes a step forward to the screening for
              mixing ability, and could be further integrated into breeding
              programs for the development of intra- or inter-specific crop
              mixtures.",
