  abstract  = "Sepsis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
               in hospitals. Early diagnosis could substantially improve the
               patient outcomes and reduce the mortality rate. In this paper we
               propose a machine learning approach for anomaly detection to aid
               the early detection of sepsis. Using the medical data of over
               40,000 patients [1], we use both unsupervised and supervised
               methods to extract relevant features from the data, and then use
               standard classification approaches to predict sepsis six hours
               before clinical diagnosis occurs. To extract features, we used
               the reconstruction error of an auto-encoding neural network
               trained on control patients free of sepsis, and used random
               forest classifiers to learn the most important features for the
               classification of patients. We then combined the features from
               both of these approaches with a variety of standard
               classification models. Cross-validation as well as the
               asymmetric utility function designed for this challenge are used
               to evaluate the resulting models. We obtained a utility function
               score for the full unseen dataset of 0.177 (Team Kriss);
               achieved with a logistic regression classifier. All the
               implementation is publicly available at
               https://github.com/ineskris/SepsisChallenge-Cinc2019.",
