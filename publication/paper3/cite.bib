  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Advancements in human genomics have generated a surge
              of available data, fueling the growth and accessibility of
              databases for more comprehensive, in-depth genetic studies.
              METHODS: We provide a straightforward and innovative methodology
              to optimize cloud configuration in order to conduct genome-wide
              association studies. We utilized Spark clusters on both Google
              Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services, as well as Hail
              (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2646680) for analysis and
              exploration of genomic variants dataset. RESULTS: Comparative
              evaluation of numerous cloud-based cluster configurations
              demonstrate a successful and unprecedented compromise between
              speed and cost for performing genome-wide association studies on
              4 distinct whole-genome sequencing datasets. Results are
              consistent across the 2 cloud providers and could be highly
              useful for accelerating research in genetics. CONCLUSIONS: We
              present a timely piece for one of the most frequently asked
              questions when moving to the cloud: what is the trade-off between
              speed and cost?",
